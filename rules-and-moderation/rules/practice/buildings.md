# 4. Buildings

A page that provides more information about the rules in the section for buildings and other constructions.

### 4.1 Vandalism

&#x20;If you destroy land just outside a city, this can also be seen as vandalism.

Exceptions are narrow pillars of low value. For example, a pillar of dirt, cobblestone, or sand.

Compensation for vandalism in nature. If the damage is done to unprotected land, the owner cannot expect to receive any compensation.

### 4.2 Unlawful engineering work

&#x20;Farm with ladders/vines: Using ladders/vines at edges in farms to prevent entity-cramming is prohibited.

Downward farm: It is okay to harvest all the downwards in a farm simultaneously using water buckets in a dispenser activated by a lever or a button.

### 4.4 Unlawful aircraft

&#x20;It is only allowed to build machines (aircraft) in controlled forms if they meet certain criteria:

* The machine must have stop blocks in the form of obsidian or furnaces at both start and stop.
* The machine may only be built on town land and on a plot intended for the machine.
* The entire path of the machine must be visible to the player (so one must be able to see the entire way between start and stop).
* The machine must not be able to change its flight direction, nor have the ability to do so with player involvement, for example, by pressing a button.

Moderators have the right to dismantle a machine they believe may threaten any building on the server or otherwise go against the above guidelines. The moderator also has no obligation to return materials from a machine that is considered to violate the rule.

### 4.6 Redstone Rules

* Passive and Active redstone farms

Active redstone machines are not allowed; however, passive machines are permitted with restrictions. They must not exceed 2 chunks in size, be stacked higher than 2 units, and should only be activated by observers, daylight sensors, or a player. Avoid constant activation of triggers, as it is considered active redstone

* &#x20;Large scale redstone farms

Each town allows only one large-scale farm (except for bamboo and kelp farms), limited to 5 by 5 chunks on a single layer. Redstone components must stay within 20% of the total farm area and operate solely on player-initiated power. Prohibited are redstone clocks, daylight sensors, and continuous triggers; instead, a button press initiates one cycle of operation.

* Redstone machinery

Non-farm-related redstone machines are welcome, provided they don't put undue strain on the server.
