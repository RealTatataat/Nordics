# 1. Cheating and Technical Issues

&#x20;A page that provides more information about the rules in the cheating and technical issues section.

#### 1.1 Use of Cheating&#x20;

The rules state that anyone who uses any form of cheating, add-ons, or programs that provide unfair advantages in the game will be judged for cheating. There are exceptions to this rule, and below is a list of modifications allowed to be used on the server.

List of allowed modifications and their guidelines:

* **Client mods:** Players are prohibited from using client mods known to cause server crashes or instability. Any client mods that have the potential to disrupt the server/player performance or cause crashes are strictly forbidden. Any concerns about specific mods should be brought to the attention of the server administrators for evaluation and approval before use.
* Freecam mods are only allowed in matters of building; in terms of war, events and conflicts are not allowed. Also allowed in terms of media and videos

Performance-enhancing

* Optifine (including Shaders), BetterFPS Mod
* Fabulously Optimized (excluding the use of analog controllers that this enables)

Armor and effect status

* Armor Status, Effect Status, HudPixel

Maps

* Minimaps are allowed if they meet these requirements:
  * The map does not show other entities or players.
  * The map does not show underground caves.

Aids

* Schematica and Litematica (or equivalent)
  * It is allowed to use Schematica or Litematica, but only for building.
* Replay Mod
  * Must not be abused to reveal hidden locations.

Brightness and gamma

* It is okay to adjust the brightness or gamma in your Minecraft client.

Aesthetic mods

* Shaders mod, Betterfoliage, Sound filters, Mo'bends

Other mods

* CraftPresence

If you have a modification you want to use that is not on the list, ask first if it is okay to use. If we approve the modification, it will be added to the list.

#### **1.3 Technical Issues**&#x20;

List of bugs that are allowed to be used. These bugs are allowed to be used because it is too difficult to control who is using them or because they do not noticeably negatively impact the server.

* Block bug, placing blocks in a place where you cannot place blocks, and thus being able to jump on them in the air.
* Water bucket bug, placing water with a bucket where you should not be able to, and thus being able to stand in non-existent water.
* Nether ceiling, it is not forbidden to get up on the ceiling (above level 128), but you die instantly because the area is declared void.

1.4 **Multi-accounting**

Generating money means logging into new accounts to use the starting cash 1the account receives. This also applies to voting. For example, you cannot vote with 3 different accounts and transfer the money from all 3 to your primary account.
