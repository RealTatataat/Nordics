# 5. Griefing & Vandalism

#### Vandalism in towns

&#x20;According to rule 4.1, destroying or taking anything you have not built or own is prohibited. This is classified as vandalism ("griefing") and theft, which can lead to a ban depending on the value of the items. If you are stolen from townland, the nation protects the material. You will receive the material back as items or money covering the value of your stolen property. If you have been stolen from a town, report it to support immediately. Provide the location by inserting coordinates and specifically tell what you have been stolen, if possible.

#### Summary in towns:

* It is not allowed to destroy or steal others' belongings in towns.
* You can be banned for vandalism and theft in towns.
* The items are returned to the owner either as items or money.
* The offender may need to pay damages to the victim.

Vandalism in nature Rule 4.1 also applies in nature. Destroying or taking anything you have not built or own is prohibited. This is classified as vandalism ("griefing"), which leads to a ban depending on the value of the items.

Note: If you build in nature, the state is not obligated to return your materials. The player who did the vandalism will be banned and punished, but no items will be returned to the victim. You choose whether you want to build on town land and be under the protection of the nation (then you are somewhat sure to receive compensation in case of vandalism or theft) or in nature, where players can destroy your builds without compensation in case of vandalism.

It is also not allowed to take over ("claim") builds that another player has built with their town; this also applies to outposts. If builds are in the way of expanding your town, create a new support case. The moderator responsible for the case will decide whether it may be taken over (regardless of whether the material should be archived).

#### Summary in nature:

* It is not allowed to destroy or steal others' belongings in nature.
* You can be banned for vandalism and theft in nature.
* You may not always get back items you have been stolen from in nature. Therefore, building in nature is at your own risk.
* The offender may not keep the items they have taken and may sometimes need to pay damages to the victim.
