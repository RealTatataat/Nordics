# 2. Behaviors

A page that provides more information about the rules in the behaviour section.

#### 2.1 Deception

&#x20;Agreements that severely disadvantage one party can also be seen as fraud. In some cases, players try to make agreements with one or more parties so that one player severely exploits the other parties.

When agreeing with another player, it is good to be clear, and both parties must understand what the agreement entails. If an agreement is made with another player, it is also good to have it documented, for example, in the server's chat logs. Agreements that have only been made verbally or on forums other than Nordics or nation groups are difficult to handle.

#### 2.2 Theft

&#x20;It also counts as theft to take over someone's constructions in nature. This is often referred to as "claiming" others' buildings.

No player is allowed to interfere with the gameplay of active players in a way that disrupts their experience. This includes but is not limited to intentionally steering/manipulating their actions, stealing their in-game possessions, or causing grief. Any such behavior will result in disciplinary action.&#x20;

* **War Exception**:
  * In the event of a designated war between players or factions, certain actions that would typically be prohibited may be allowed within the context of the war. This may include:
    * Temporary allowance for stealing resources or items from opposing players or factions as part of the war effort.
    * Permission for limited manipulation of in-game assets, such as altering structures or terrain within the context of the war or conflict. (Admins may revert large changes, ex opposition setting towns, ships on fire)
    * Clear communication and agreement on the rules of engagement and what actions are permissible during the war to ensure that all involved players understand the boundaries of acceptable behavior.
