Amsterdam was founded by [NL\_Kommiedant](../../players/nl\_kommiedant.md) with one purpose, to reconstruct or form Netherlands since it was missing from the realm. A massive undertaking considering the size of the space needed to be reclaimed from the ocean. An initial [work plan](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] was drawn up on May 17, 2024 and serve as a guide on how the new country should be formed. The scale of the project meant it would take a lot of resources and time to build, but it didn't scare [NL\_Kommiedant](../../players/nl\_kommiedant.md) from the project.

The first build steps involved the construction of a larger road to easily move across the work site, this involved a lot off tree burning that luckily and professionally was kept contained and under control.
