After the announcement of the relaunch of the Nordic Union Minecraft server the old members of the Golden Union started background talks about reintroducing the once powerful nation. The demand from the users was lackluster to say the least with few members actually agreeing on the venture. At the end only two people stood behind the decision of creating a settlement together, Seeyouman and Svardmastaren founded the city of Northstar on September 9th, 2023.

Today the town consists of a mix of citizens from other towns and newcomers to the realm that joined the peaceful town. All with the common goal of remaining peaceful and building a friendly community for all.

## Founding principles

Northstar was founded with some very specific principles in mind, Seeyouman and Svardmastaren had a long discussion of what the town's goals and focuses would be. Being situated between the major towns of Copenhagen and Aquaria a goal of remaining neutral was quickly set in stone. Northmen would work together to maintain peace and the neutral image of Northstar as a town.&#x20;

Democracy was therefore important and would let all members have their say in the town's development and major decision of diplomacy. Even down to the fact of accepting new members into the town, a majority of members should agree on a person joining the settlement. Only trustworthy members would therefore be let in and partake in the town’s construction.&#x20;

Resources were to be shared between members, being part of Northstar should be an economical burden to the citizen therefore all citizens are encouraged to donate money to the town’s bank for survival but not required. Taxing the citizens was therefore not an option, the same would later include no tax for towns under the Constellation roof.&#x20;

The founders also agreed on never becoming a nation, this was to remain small and keep neutrality since the memory of Golden Union getting attacked was still fresh in the founders minds.&#x20;
