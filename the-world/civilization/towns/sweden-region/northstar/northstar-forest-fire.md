# Northstar Forest Fire

On the evening of May 19, 2024, [Volymskala](../../../players/volymskala.md) alerted the current players on the server to a fire that had just started spreading in the forest surrounding the town of [Northstar](./). As a fellow citizen of Constellation, [\_Bamson ](../../../players/bamson.md)answered the call. The fire, thought to have been ignited by a thunderstorm minutes earlier, had rooted itself deep and proved unquenchable despite the frantic efforts of the two individuals working to extinguish it.

As the fire continued to spread, the decision was made to unload the chunks and wait until the next day when more people could help to put out the fire.
