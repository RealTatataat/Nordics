# Euro - the virtual currency

When logging into the server for the first time, one receives 250 Euros as initial capital. This hopefully provides enough to purchase a first plot in a town to settle in, but it probably won't be enough for much more.

To see how much Euro one or someone else has, the command `/balance` can be used.

#### Ways to Wealth

There are many ways to earn Euro, and often, only imagination (and the rules!) sets the limits for the methods one can use to increase their wealth. Most ways to earn Euro involve trade with other players or the state. Below is a list of examples of how to earn Euro:

* Sell items to other players.
* Work for another player or for a town.&#x20;
* ~~Vote on the server - a quick way to get 20 Euros daily (30 if you are a Patron).~~ [Read more](vote-for-the-server-get-payed.md)
* ~~Participate and win in competitions.~~
* Fishing and selling the fish using `/sellfish all`
* Selling Haybales with `/sell all` [Read more](make-money.md)

#### Things one must pay for&#x20;

When playing on Nordics, one can, of course choose whether to, for example, buy things from other players or not. If one is short of Euro, it may be a good idea to refrain from buying anything, especially if saving up for something expensive. However, there are some things that one generally has to pay for, whether one wants to or not.

#### Town tax:&#x20;

One can assume that one has to pay town tax if one lives in a town. It is a sum of euros automatically deducted from one's wallet every midnight and sent to the town's treasury. Even if circumstances mean one does not always pay town tax, one should still assume they do.

#### Fines and damages:&#x20;

If one commits a rule violation, they may sometimes have to pay fines or damages. Both fines and damages are things one is required to pay, but the purpose differs slightly. Fines are paid as punishment, and the money goes to the nation. Damages are not part of a punishment but something paid as compensation to one or more players who have been harmed due to the rule violation committed.
