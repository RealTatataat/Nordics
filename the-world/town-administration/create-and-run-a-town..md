# Create and run a town.

An option if you do not want to join an existing town is to create a new one. By creating a new town, you become the mayor of the town and have more overall control than if you were a regular member. Owning a town also means increased responsibility, especially when it comes to maintaining a good economy.

When you own a town, you can decide for yourself whether it should be open to everyone or if all new members should need to be invited to join. To facilitate the daily work, you can appoint assistants who share the tasks within the town.

Important things to consider: It is good to have some friends who want to join when starting a new town, at least 3-4 people. Running a town completely alone is very time-consuming. If you have created a town, you must ensure that there is money in its town treasury. If you do not, there is a risk that the town cannot pay the national tax, which can result in the town going under.

#### Starting a town&#x20;

To start a new town, you first need to find a suitable place to start it. If you have difficulty finding a good place, you can get a lot of inspiration by taking the train and getting off at a station you have not previously visited. It is also possible to use the map to find a suitable place. Avoid starting a town near another town. It can limit the opportunities for both towns to grow in the future.

Minimum distance from other towns To create a new town, you must stand at least 2,000 blocks from all other town starting points and at least 400 blocks from all other town land blocks. However, we recommend that you find a place where the distance is much longer than that to all other towns. This avoids problems with claiming land in the future.

#### Maintain your town&#x20;

When you own a town, it comes with automatic responsibilities, mainly to ensure that you can pay for the town's expenses. For every plot your town has, there is a fee of €0.2 per plot and an additional €5 base cost.\
The bigger the town, the more money you will need to gain from the members. One way is to set up taxes, read more about taxes [here](../economy/taxes/town-tax.md)
